## Unified CRM Architecture & Database Model

PostgreSQL serves as the single source of truth across all CRM entities with relational foreign keys:

- **Lead** (`leads`): Captures inquiries. Has foreign key `customer_id` → `customers.id`.
- **Customer** (`customers`): Created or linked upon lead contact or direct creation. Central entity linking projects, surveys, and leads.
- **Site Survey** (`site_surveys`): Technical feasibility assessment. Has foreign keys `customer_id` → `customers.id`, `lead_id` → `leads.id`, and `project_id` → `projects.id`.
- **Project** (`projects`): Solar installation pipeline. Has foreign keys `customer_id` → `customers.id` and `source_lead_id` → `leads.id`.
- **Activity** (`activities`): Audit logging table recording all lifecycle events (`lead_created`, `lead_contacted`, `survey_scheduled`, `survey_completed`, `project_created`, `project_status_changed`, `customer_created`).

## Setup

From the `backend/` directory, create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
```

Configure `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env`. PostgreSQL is the default database for local development and production.

---

## Database Migrations & Seeding

Apply all Alembic migrations (including `003_crm_relationships_and_activity`):

```powershell
alembic upgrade head
```

Seed the database with the admin account and interconnected sample CRM records:

```powershell
python seed.py
```

- Seed admin account: `admin@solara.com` / `admin123`
- Database tables populated: `users`, `customers`, `leads`, `site_surveys`, `projects`, `activities`, `blogs`, `faqs`, `system_settings`.
